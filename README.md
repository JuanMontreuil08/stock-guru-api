Have you thought about investing in the USA stock market but don't know where to start? Or are you a beginner investor looking to take control of your portfolio and improve your investment decisions? This repository might be just what you're looking for.

I have developed a multimodal agent that delivers easy-to-understand, concrete, and relevant information about S&P 500 companies (Apple, Tesla, Airbnb, etc). Whether through voice, text message, or a concise email report, it helps users stay informed effortlessly.

## Agent Toolkit

Stock Guru has access to the following tools to provide answers to the user's queries:

**1. Tiingo API:** Fetch historical stock prices for a given ticker within a date range. The tool outputs a dataframe with the date and closing price.

**2. AlphaVantage News Search API:** Retrieve up to 5 news articles for a given ticker within a date range. The code includes an algorithm that filters the request's output by relevance_score to ensure the articles are relevant to the provided ticker.

**3. Retrieval-Augmented Generation - Earnings Calls Transcripts:** RAG tool to extract company information, results, and analyses discussed in the earnings call for a given ticker, quarter, and year.

**4. OpenAI Text-To-Speech:** Using the **gpt-4o-mini-tts** model, the agent can generate a speech stored in mp3 format.

**5. Google Cloud Storage:** Tool to upload the generated mp3 file to Google Cloud Storage in order to make it public. The tool outputs a public url.

**6. GMAIL:** The agent can send its responses in HTML format to the user's email address.
